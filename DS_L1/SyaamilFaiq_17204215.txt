My name is Muhammad Syaamil Fa'iq bin Zabisham with matrix number, 17204215. I am majoring in Software Engineering. 

This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. 

At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because this is my first time taking this subject.
I have performed well in the class and I am very happy with my performance. DS has taught me how to be a better programmer and I am very happy that I achieved my targetted grade. I did well in the continuous assesments and I hope to improve more in DS.
